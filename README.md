Problem:
A finance team receives multiple supplier invoices each week and currently processes them manually by opening each document, extracting key details, and summarizing purchases. 
This approach is time-consuming, prone to errors, and makes it difficult to quickly identify which invoices are due by specific dates. 

Solution:
The goal is to automate invoice processing (RPA) by reading files from Google Drive, extracting key fields, generating short purchase descriptions with AI, and writing results into Google Sheets. The workflow also flags low-confidence data for manual review, ensuring accuracy while saving time.

Benfits:

Saves time by eliminating manual invoice reading and data entry.


Reduces errors through automated extraction and confidence checks.


Improves visibility with a structured Google Sheet showing all key invoice fields.


Adds context via AI-generated purchase descriptions for quick understanding.


Supports compliance by flagging low-confidence totals for manual review.


Scales easily to handle larger volumes of invoices as the company grows.
